<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>When I began to write these stories about children of
all lands I had just returned from Europe whither I journeyed
with Marie and Ref. Maybe you don't know Marie
and Ref. I'll introduce them: Please meet Marie, my very
little daughter, and Ref, my very big reflex camera.</p>

<p>These two are my helpers. Marie helps by being a little
girl who knows what other little girls like and by telling
me; and Ref helps by snapping pictures of everything
interesting that Marie and I see on our travels. I couldn't
get along without them.</p>

<p>Several years have gone by since we started our work
together and Marie is a bigger girl&mdash;but Ref hasn't
changed one bit. Ref hasn't changed any more than my interest
in writing these books for you. And I hope that <i>you</i>
hope that I'll never change, because I want to keep on
writing until we'll have no more countries to write about&mdash;unless,
of course, some one discovers a new country.</p>

<p>Even if a new country isn't discovered, we'll find foreign
children to talk about&mdash;maybe the children in Mars! Who
knows? Nobody. Not even Marie&mdash;and Marie usually
knows about most things. That's the reason why, you see,
though I sign myself<br /></p>

<h2>WILL YOU WALK INTO MY STORY&mdash;?</h2>


<p>Just because I think it may interest you to know
it:&mdash;In these photographs Kit Wain posed for Shaun
O'Day. Kit is a real Irish boy, but he did not have
the adventures that Shaun had in the story. He has
had many other adventures, however, because Kit is
a young actor. Dawn O'Day was played by Mary Jo
Desmond. Mary Jo is just a little schoolgirl like you.
She looked so much like Dawn O'Day in the story
that I asked her to be Dawn for me. And because she
is Irish and loves make-believe, she did it.</p>

<p>When Shaun grew older it was Maurice Murphy
who posed. Maurice has had a wonderful life for a
young boy. He has played on the stage and in motion
pictures and also on the piano! For he is a very
talented young musician. Maybe you remember seeing
him act in the film called "Beau Geste."</p>

<p>Little saucy Marjorie was posed by a little saucy
miss who is known as Carmencita Johnson. I should
say "well known" because Carmencita, though only
five, is already a picture star. She is a very interesting
young person, and if I began to tell you all about
her and her family of sisters and brothers it would
take up all the book and leave no room for the story.</p>

<p>John O'Day, Shaun's son, is portrayed by another
little film artist. His name is Gordon Thorpe. Gordon
is only six. But he has appeared in more than
sixty motion pictures. Do you remember the little
Prince in Douglas Fairbanks' "The Iron Mask?"
That was Gordon. And in "The Bridge of San Luis
Rey?" You surely recognized him.</p>

<p>Dick Good was the fighting boy who didn't believe
that Marjorie was a fairy. And of course I need not
tell you that the scenes of cities and buildings and
places in Ireland were all played by those cities and
buildings and places <i>themselves</i>.</p>

<p>That is, when I was in Ireland I asked them to
pose for me. And they did it willingly the way the children
did. They posed very well, in fact. Very quietly.</p>

<p>Only the rain in Ireland is not willing. The rain
does not want photographers to catch the beauty of
the country. The rain tries to spoil everything for
the poor photographers. But we forgive him because
he makes Ireland so green.</p>

<p>Here are the names of the little children who
helped me so nicely by coming to Marjorie's birthday
party and posing as her guests: Alice and Howard
Bucquet, Caroline Kuhns, Barbara and Patrick Ford,
Betty and Stephen Kline, Marie Madeleine Brandeis
and Dietrich Haupt.</p>

<p>The only grown-up in the story, John's girl-fairy,
is Miss Alice White. Miss White is such a busy star
that I think I should thank her for stopping long
enough from her work to be John's girl-fairy in the
pages of this book. And I think I should thank all
the rest of these good people, even if they are only
little people, for they too, are busy. And it is sometimes
hard to tear oneself away from the work of
the world and walk into a fairy tale.</p>

<p>But these in the photographs did it. And that is
what I am going to ask you, young readers, to do
now. Come along! See if you can!</p>

ISN'T IT A GREAT WONDER?</h2>

<span class="i0">The wee word "why"<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Isn't it a great wonder&mdash;the fair
green Emerald Isle?</p>

<p>And do you know why Ireland is so
green? It is because the rain fairies
love Ireland. They have made it the
greenest spot on earth. They do
be sprinkling it forever with the drops
of their fairy rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Ireland is divided into four provinces.
They are Ulster, Leinster, Munster,
and Connaught.</p>

<p>In Connaught is the County of Galway.
In the County of Galway is the
District of Connemara.</p>

<p>In Connemara there is a village that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
looks out upon a lake. And in that village
are wee houses covered with
thatched roofs&mdash;roofs of straw.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus014.jpg" width="600" height="476" alt="WEE HOUSES COVERED WITH STRAW ROOFS" />
<span class="caption">WEE HOUSES COVERED WITH STRAW ROOFS</span>
</div>

<p>Inside one of these houses there lived
a boy, Shaun O'Day. But I am not going
to tell you now about Shaun O'Day,
nor of the strange thing that befell
him. Not now.</p>

<p>First, I shall tell you about his country.
I shall tell you about his country
because all children love to know the
why and the wonder of things. And
great is the wonder of Ireland.</p>

<p>This is the tale of the Province of
Connaught and how it got its name.
Long ago the western districts of Ireland
were named after the person who
took possession of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time there reigned a powerful
king whose name was Conn. He
was good as well as great, and dearly
loved by his people.</p>

<p>His Queen was equally beloved. Her
name was Eda. Their son was a blessed
and good boy. They named him Conn-eda,
after both his parents.</p>

<p>As Conn-eda grew to manhood, his
strength and goodness grew with his
years. All was harmony in the west
until a great sorrow fell upon the land.
The Queen died. The country mourned
for a year and a day.</p>

<p>And then the King married again.
But the new Queen was not good and
kind as Queen Eda had been. She was
wicked and cruel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus017.jpg" width="600" height="422" alt="CONNEMARA PEOPLE ENGAGED IN SPINNING" />
<span class="caption">CONNEMARA PEOPLE ENGAGED IN SPINNING</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>She had several children of her own,
and was jealous of Conn-eda, who was
the favorite of the King and the darling
of the people.</p>

<p>She clearly foresaw that Conn-eda
would be King after the death of his
father. She wanted her own son to become
King some day.</p>

<p>And so she planned to destroy Conn-eda
or have him exiled from the country.
With envy and hatred in her heart,
the wicked Queen went to consult a
witch.</p>

<p>The witch gave the Queen a chess-board
and told her to invite Prince
Conn-eda to play a game of chess.</p>

<p>The witch said to the Queen, "The
loser of this game shall be obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
obey the orders of the winner. And,
you, great Queen, shall win the game!
Having won the game, you are to send
the Prince Conn-eda upon a dangerous
journey. He must seek and bring to
you, within a year and a day, three
golden apples, a magical black steed,
and the Hound of Supernatural Powers.
These things are so well guarded
that the Prince will surely lose his life
in attempting to seek them."</p>

<p>The Queen was delighted and hastened
to invite Conn-eda to play a
game of chess. He agreed to the conditions
of the game, and it came about
as the witch had promised. The wicked
Queen won.</p>

<span class="caption">SUBSTANTIAL HOMES IN A WOODLAND SETTING ON THE KILLARNEY RIVER</span>
</div>

<p>But so pleased was she with her triumph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a><br /><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and so greedy for further power
that she challenged the Prince to another
game. To the Queen's astonishment
and horror, Conn-eda won this
second game.</p>

<p>"Since you won the first game," said
Conn-eda, "you shall be first to command
your reward."</p>

<p>The Queen said, "My reward shall be
the three golden apples, the Black
Steed, and the Hound of Supernatural
Powers. These you must seek and
bring to me within the space of a year
and a day. If you fail you must leave
your country forever or lose your life."</p>

<p>Conn-eda answered, "Then my order
to you is that you sit upon the topmost
spire of yonder tower until I return.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
If I do not return, you may come down
at the end of the year and a day."</p>

<p>Conn-eda was troubled and went to
consult with a great Druid. The poor
Prince had no idea how he was to find
these magical treasures.</p>

<p>The great Druid gave the Prince a
little, shaggy pony. He bade Conn-eda
obey this little horse.</p>

<p>After further instructions from the
great Druid, Conn-eda mounted the
shaggy steed and set out upon his
journey.</p>

<p>His adventures were many. Through
them all, the little shaggy horse helped
and guided him. The animal had the
power of speech.</p>

<p>After days of hardship and danger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Conn-eda reached the walls of a great
city. Two huge towers stood on
either side of the gate and sent forth
flames of fire. The pony bade Conn-eda
alight from his back and take from his
ear a small knife.</p>

<p>"With this knife," said the steed, "kill
me! Then wrap yourself in my skin,
and you shall be able to pass the gates
of the city unharmed. All I ask is that
you return to my body and pour a drop
of this powerful ointment upon my
poor flesh."</p>

<p>With these words the pony gave
Conn-eda a bottle of magic fluid.</p>

<p>The Prince cried, "Never, never! I
would rather die than kill you, my
good friend!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>But at last the pony persuaded Conn-eda,
and the Prince stabbed his noble
steed. His heart bled, and he was in
despair at what he had done.</p>

<p>But he suddenly thought of the bottle
of fluid which the steed had given
him. Following the animal's advice,
the Prince poured the ointment over
the horse's body.</p>

<p>No sooner had he done this than the
horse's shape changed to the form of a
handsome young man.</p>

<p>"Behold!" cried the noble youth.
"You have freed me from a wicked enchantment.
I am brother of the King
of the city. It was a wicked Druid who
kept me so long in the form of a shaggy
steed. Now, through your brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a><br /><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
act, you have broken the spell, and I
shall help you in your quest."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus025.jpg" width="600" height="420" alt="LOCH DERG AT KILLALOE, EMPTYING INTO THE RIVER SHANNON" />
<span class="caption">LOCH DERG AT KILLALOE, EMPTYING INTO THE RIVER SHANNON</span>
</div>

<p>The handsome Prince asked his
brother, the King, for those treasures
which Conn-eda sought. Gladly did
the King give to him the apples from
his magic tree, the Black Steed, and
the precious hound. With these three
treasures did Conn-eda return to his
country.</p>

<p>The wicked Queen, who was sitting
upon the top of her tower, saw Conn-eda
approaching. She saw him riding
upon a prancing steed and leading a
curious animal by a silver chain.</p>

<p>The Queen knew that he was returning
in triumph. In despair she cast herself
from the tower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>That was her end. And that was also
the end of trouble in the kingdom of
the west. For at the death of the good
King Conn, his son Conn-eda was made
king. Conn-eda ruled wisely, and it
was after his name that the province
of Connaught was called.</p>

<p>In Connaught is the County of Galway.
Sheep are raised in Galway. And
it has a rugged, wild seacoast.</p>

<p>It was on this coast that the wreck
of part of the Spanish Armada took
place in 1588. For this reason there is
still to be found, in this part of Ireland,
people of Spanish descent. And the
fairies are said to love the County of
Galway. In Galway County is the District
of Connemara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Once upon a time there dwelt a powerful
family named Conmac. In Irish
"Connemara" means "Seaside of the
Conmacs," for it was this wild and
rocky shore that was used by these
ancient royal people as their seaside.</p>

<p>Connemara is called the Congested
District of Ireland. The word "congested"
means "overcrowded." But in
this case it does not mean that the
country is overcrowded with people.
For the people are few here in this
wild land.</p>

<p>But the barren soil does not yield
enough for those few people. And
there is much poverty in Connemara.</p>

<p>But there also are lakes of great
beauty, and valuable marble, known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a><br /><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
as Connemara marble. And there are
fairies! Well do the fairies love Connemara!</p>

<span class="caption">IRISH FARMER AND HIS SON PATCHING THE ROOF OF

</div>

<p>In Connemara there is a village, and
in that village lived a boy named
Shaun O'Day.</p>

<p>Do you know the why of that name
Shaun? It is the same as the name
John. But it is an Irish name. It is
spelled "Sean" in Irish and pronounced
"hwan."</p>

<p>It is Jean in French, and Giovanni in
Italian, and Hans in German, and Ivan
in Russian. It is Juan in Spanish, Jock
in Scotch, and Johnny in American.</p>

<p>It is a Hebrew word and has a very
beautiful meaning: "Gift of God." Do
you wonder that so many boys all over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the world are given the name John?</p>

<p>Here we have the why and the wonder
of the land of Shaun O'Day. So
now we shall hear of the strange things
that befell this lad, who lived in the
Emerald Isle.</p>

<p>We have been speaking of the fairies
and how they love Ireland.</p>

<p>The fairies are divided into tribes
just the way Ireland itself is divided
into many districts, counties, and provinces.</p>

<p>There are many tribes of fairies, and
these tribes are all quite different
from one another.</p>

<p>There are those who dress like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
flowers; and those that change themselves
into various shapes. There are
evil fairies and solitary fairies.</p>

<p>You must always call them the
"Good People," for they are easily offended.</p>

<p>But if you believe in them and leave
a bit of milk for them upon the window
sill, they will bring luck and happiness
to you.</p>

<p>Now the fairy that we are going to
meet in this story is called the leprechaun,
or fairy shoemaker. We are going
to meet him, because if it had not
been for him, there would be no story
at all.</p>

<p>The fairy shoemaker sits under a
toadstool making tiny shoes. The word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
"leprechaun" comes from two Irish
words meaning "one shoe." The reason
he bears this name is because he is always
working upon one shoe.</p>

<p>The leprechaun is quick and mysterious.
He is also mischievous. And
one of his great pranks is stealing wee
boys away.</p>

<p>He steals wee Irish boys away from
their homes because they do work so
well. He makes them work for himself&mdash;this
mischief-making fairy!</p>

<p>He will not bother with wee girls.</p>

<p>"Wee girls are not so strong as wee
boys," says he.</p>

<p>So when you meet Shaun O'Day, you
must not be surprised to find him
wearing a petticoat! You must not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
surprised, because it is the fault of the
leprechaun.</p>

<p>You see, Shaun O'Day lived in a very
western part of Ireland, in Connemara,
where fairies abound.</p>

<p>And in the village where he lived,
the boys were all dressed in red petticoats!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
They were dressed in red flannel
petticoats until they reached a tall
and manly age.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">HE WORE A FLANNEL PETTICOAT</span>
</div>

<p>This was many years ago. And
though they would not tell you why
they wore those petticoats, I am telling
you 'twas because of the leprechauns.</p>

<p>Every wee boy's mother feared the
leprechaun. And so she dressed her
boy in the dress of the girl to trick that
sly creature.</p>

<p>Boys were needed badly by the human
folk. Why should the fairy folk
be taking them away?</p>

<p>Shaun had a good, kind father. He
was a fisherman. Shaun's mother was
dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>But Shaun and his father lived happily
enough until one day Shaun's
father married again.</p>

<p>He married a woman who had four
sons. Grown-up boys they were, and
lazy.</p>

<p>Like the Queen in the story of Conn-eda,
this woman was unkind. Little
love had she for Shaun, and she made
him work hard.</p>

<p>Poor little lad! He was very young
when he had to labor like a full grown
man, while the sons of his stepmother
rested or played.</p>

<p>Shaun was always called Shauneen
by his father, who loved him dearly.
"Shauneen" means "little Shaun."
"Een" is the Irish for "little."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Shauneen, lad," said the father,
one night after his return from sea,
"'tis tired you look, and worn. Faith!
Can the school work be so hard?"</p>

<p>Shaun did not tell his father that the
wicked stepmother had kept him from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
school that day. He did not tell his
father that she had made him walk
upon an errand, miles and miles away.
He did not say that she had beaten him
when he returned.</p>

<p>Shaun was often tempted to tell
these things to his good, kind father.
But he feared to cause the poor man
sorrow.</p>

<p>"Sure, and 'twould be a pity to cause
him grief, and he so good," the lad had
often thought to himself. "And I can
bear it all, for have I not himself to
love me?"</p>

<p>Shauneen was a brave boy and felt
that to whimper to his father would be
weak.</p>

<p>He was a sturdy little lad. His hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
was Irish red and his cheeks were
bright and rosy from the damp, rainy
wind. He was strong and manly.</p>

<p>He hated the red petticoat he was
forced to wear. Often he had thought
of putting on the clothing of a real
boy.</p>

<p>But always in his heart, as in the
hearts of other village boys, there
was the fear of the leprechaun!</p>

<p>And if he were stolen away, what
would his dear father do? His dear
father, who loved him!</p>

<p>It was only because of his father that
Shauneen did not give himself to the
fairies.</p>

<p>He would not have been afraid of
the fairies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>He would have liked them to take
him away. They could not be so cruel
as his stepmother.</p>

<p>Sometimes Shaun's stepmother
made him mind her baby. He had to
carry it upon his back. Many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
village boys did this sort of thing, and
so it was not the disgrace that it would
be in a present-day city.</p>

<p>He often went down to the shore.</p>

<p>To-day as he approached the shore,
he met a friend. This friend was a girl,
the daughter of a neighbor. Her name
was Eileen. But Shauneen did not call
her that.</p>

<p>She was his little schoolgirl sweetheart,
and he called her Dawn. He
called her Dawn because he told her
that she was the dawn of day to him.</p>

<p>"Some day," he said, "'tis myself,
Shaun O'Day, will marry you. Then
you will be in truth my Dawn O'Day."</p>

<p>To-day they looked out across the
great ocean and dreamed of a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
world out there. They dreamed of
America.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus038.jpg" width="600" height="493" alt="THEY FANCIED AMERICA" />
<span class="caption">THEY FANCIED AMERICA</span>
</div>

<p>And Shaun said, "When I am tall and
strong, I shall take you in a ship to
America. Och, we'll be after building
a houseen in the New Island!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The New Island was their Irish name
for America.</p>

<p>It was a rainy day, but they did not
notice it. Rain is nothing to Irish children.
And as they talked together on
the shore in the drizzling rain, they
heard a strange cry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus041.jpg" width="600" height="479" alt="THEY HEARD A STRANGE CRY" />
<span class="caption">THEY HEARD A STRANGE CRY</span>
</div>

<p>Louder grew the cry, and suddenly
they saw men and women running
toward the shore. They heard the
women wailing. They heard the
tramp, tramp of men's heavy boots.</p>

<p>Shaun stood up, with the baby on his
back. He shaded his eyes and looked.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">SHAUN STOOD UP WITH THE BABY ON HIS BACK</span>
</div>

<p>The girl stood, too. She gave a low
cry.</p>

<p>"Och, Shauneen!" she moaned. "'Tis
a fishing boat has been wrecked! Och,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the poor wives and children of the
men 'twere in it!"</p>

<p>And she moaned and rocked back
and forth.</p>

<p>The waters made a roaring sound.
The sky was leaden gray. The men
were working, pulling in the wreck of
the boat.</p>

<p>Shaun gave the baby to Eileen. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the boy in his red petticoat started to
run.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus045.jpg" width="600" height="387" alt="HE STARTED TO RUN" />
<span class="caption">HE STARTED TO RUN</span>
</div>

<p>His feet were bare, but he could
skim over those rough rocks like a
wild animal. His feet never had
known shoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>His ruddy face had gone white. He
reached the group of working men
and moaning women. Then he fell upon
his face, and a great sob came from his
heart.</p>

<p>Among the lost men was his own
father!</p>

COME AWAY</h2>

<p>The sea had taken away Shaun's
only loved one.</p>

<p>Shaun O'Day stood upon the banks
of the little lake near his village. He
stared out across the blue Irish lake.
That morning his stepmother had
beaten him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">HE STARED OUT ACROSS THE BLUE IRISH LAKE</span>
</div>

<p>It was several months since the sea
accident had taken his father from
him. It was several sad, cruel months
to the boy Shaun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>If it had not been for his little Dawn
O'Day, Shaun would have run away.
He would have run and run&mdash;anywhere
to get away from this life of
hard work and cruelty.</p>

<p>But he did not want to leave little
Dawn O'Day. She pleaded with him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
stay. She was afraid of the fairies.</p>

<p>To-day he stood beside the lake, and
he had a bundle by his side. It was a
bulky bundle. He had worked hard all
that morning. He had helped the men
burn kelp.</p>

<p>Kelp is seaweed. The people burn it
and make iodine from what is left of
it. Kelp burning is an important occupation
in western Ireland.</p>

<p>Shaun had worked hard. His little
rough hands burned. His little sturdy
body ached. He was hungry.</p>

<p>He had gone home and, seeing the
family at dinner, he had helped himself
to potatoes.</p>

<p>His stepmother had cried, "Begob,
and did I tell you to serve yourself?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Are you, indeed, the King himself?"</p>

<p>With that, she had beaten him.</p>

<p>Now Shaun stood upon the shore of
that blue Irish lake near his village.
He had taken a suit of clothes belonging
to one of his stepbrothers. A suit
of boy's clothes it was.</p>

<p>He would put it on. He would stand
by the lake and call to the leprechauns
to take him away. He would work for
the leprechauns. Yes, willingly would
he work and toil for the fairy folk!</p>

<p>He started to undo the paper in
which he had wrapped the clothing. He
heard a sound and looked up. Eileen
was standing before him. It was his
little Dawn O'Day.</p>

<p>"Shauneen, och, Shauneen!" she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
cried. "What is it you are about to do?
And why do you look that way?"</p>

<p>Shaun did not answer. He took her
hand. They sat together on the bank
of the lake.</p>

<p>"Faith, speak to me, Shauneen!"
cried the girl, the tears starting to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
eyes. "Speak and tell me that you are
not after calling the lep&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped suddenly. One should
not talk about them. They are easily
offended.</p>

<p>Shaun kept looking out across the
lake, but he held the hand of his little
sweetheart. At last he spoke.</p>

<p>"Sure, I am leaving you, Dawn
O'Day," he said.</p>

<p>As she started to cry out, he held up
his hand and said, "No; do not cry, for
I cannot stay. But do not fear that I
shall forget you. The dream we made
together shall come true. I'll be
coming back to you. For there's not a
faireen like you in all the world, at all."</p>

<p>Dawn O'Day began to cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus052.jpg" width="600" height="446" alt="SHE PLEADED WITH HIM TO STAY" />
<span class="caption">SHE PLEADED WITH HIM TO STAY</span>
</div>

<p>She sobbed, "Och, don't be after
leaving me! Don't be after going to
them. Och, 'tis themselves will be
keeping you, and never will Dawn
O'Day see you again!"</p>

<p>Shaun laughed and stroked her little
hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus055.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="HE TOOK HER HAND" />
<span class="caption">HE TOOK HER HAND</span>
</div>

<p>"Troth, do not fret, mavourneen," he
said. "Sure, you know well I'll be
writing to you, and never will I forget
you, my Dawn O'Day."</p>

<p>The little girl knew that it was useless
to say more. The boy stood up,
and she stood, too. They looked into
each other's blue eyes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">"DO NOT FRET, MAVOURNEEN"</span>
</div>

<p>And then Eileen ran as fast as she
could. She ran away from her little
friend and sobbed as she ran. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
thought she should never again see her
Shauneen.</p>

<p>The boy quickly changed his clothing.
He tied a large rock to the red
petticoat and threw it into the lake.
He stood there in the garments of a
boy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus059.jpg" width="500" height="643" alt="HE TIED A ROCK TO THE PETTICOAT" />
<span class="caption">HE TIED A ROCK TO THE PETTICOAT</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<p>He held out his arms and cried,
"Come, leprechauns! Sure, I'm ready
to go with you!"</p>

<p>There was no fear in his heart. Any
other boy in that village would have
trembled at doing such a thing. But
other boys were contented at home.</p>

<p>Other boys had mothers and fathers
and good homes. They did not want
to be stolen away. Shauneen was not
afraid.</p>

<p>He stood and called as he stood. He
was straight and strong. He would
make a splendid helper for a shoemaker.
Why did the fairy shoemakers
not come and take him? He stood
there until dusk. Then he grew tired
and lay down to sleep. He slept long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
It was early dawn when he awoke.</p>

<p>He stood once more and called out,
"I am ready to go. Come, leprechauns,
come!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus060.jpg" width="600" height="463" alt="&quot;COME, LEPRECHAUNS! I'M READY TO GO&quot;" />
<span class="caption">"COME, LEPRECHAUNS! I'M READY TO GO"</span>
</div>

<p>But not a one came. And the lad was
puzzled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Shaun was keen. He was one
who thought and planned. He did not
intend to go back to his stepmother.</p>

<p>He began to wonder whether the
tale of the leprechauns was true. Had
anyone ever really seen one? Only old
Patch, the village shoemaker, and he
was half-witted.</p>

<p>But no one had been with Patch
when he had seen the leprechaun. No
one ever had seen the fairies; but they
all believed. They believed so much
that they were in daily dread of them.</p>

<p>They left milk upon window sills and
made charms to keep the fairies from
doing evil. They dressed their boys in
red petticoats.</p>

<p>But Shaun would never again wear a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
red petticoat. He would never again
return to his stepmother.</p>

<p>Even if the fairies did not steal him,
he would
never return.
He
would go
somewhere.
Perhaps to
the "New Island"&mdash;America!
As
he was thinking
these
thoughts,
he found
himself walking toward the shore.
There was a weak light in the sky.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
The rugged shore was blue in the
haze of dawn.</p>

<p>The boy could see a boat. Men were
hauling things and making ready to set
off for somewhere. Shaun was quick,
and before he knew what he had done
he had slid into the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>He crouched upon the bottom, under
a seat. He made himself as small as a
bundle of rags.</p>

<p>He lay very still. He felt the boat
leave the shore and he heard the men
talking and singing. The water rolled
the boat about, and sometimes the
spray came in and wet the men.</p>

<p>But Shaun was dry and warm under
the seat. He hardly breathed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

THE STRANGE LAND</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Out of the old world<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Into the new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True land or fairyland,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Say, which are you?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Shaun O'Day has been stolen by the
leprechauns!" That was the whisper
that buzzed all about the village the
next day.</p>

<p>Little Eileen, with swollen eyes, told
her mother how she had left the lad on
the bank of the lake. She told how he
had planned to put on the clothing of
a boy and call the fairies. She wept
as she told how brave he had been and
how he had promised to write to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Her mother smiled sadly and said,
"Och, the poor lad will never write!
Never will Ireland see himself again!
Sure, it's lost he is, and he standing by
the banks of that lake in the clothing
of a man child! For the fairies do be
looking for his likes. Well pleased
were they surely to find him!"</p>

<p>She sighed, and so did all the rest of
the village folk. They all left milk upon
their window sills that night.</p>

<p>They spoke together of the Good
People and said, "God bless them!"</p>

<p>For, you see, they wanted to win the
good will of the fairies.</p>

<p>Shaun's stepmother was as certain
as any of the rest that the boy had
been stolen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>She said, "And luck to the Good People!
May they work the lazy lad and
make a man of him!"</p>

<p>She was not sorry for Shaun. But she
was sorry for herself that he was not
there to work for her any more.</p>

<p>In a few months nobody spoke of
Shaun in the village. He was forgotten.
He was forgotten by all but little
Eileen. She thought of him each day.</p>

<p>And ofttimes she went to the lake
and talked to the blue waters. She
asked them where the fairies had taken
her Shauneen.</p>

<p>But the wind only blew ripples over
the blue waters of the lake. And the
trees sighed, and Eileen ran home crying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not tell her mother. She kept
her secret in her heart and kept her
heart open for Shauneen.</p>

<p>Then one day after many months, a
letter came to the town. It was for
Eileen. It came from a strange land;
and everyone in the village was curious
about it.</p>

<p>Some of the old folks in the village
did not know English. They spoke only
Irish. But the children in the village
all knew English, for they studied it in
school.</p>

<p>The letter to Eileen was written in
English. The little girl ran to the side
of the blue lake. She opened the letter
with trembling fingers.</p>

<p>This is what she read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dawn O'Day, I have traveled far.
The many lands I've seen and the many
strange things would open wide your
eyes. I am in a fairy city. The lights
at night do be shining like the stars.
And the noise is like a thousand thunders.</p>

<p>"But the shoemaker is kind. I work
hard, but I am paid a handsome sum.
And I study at night in a fine school. I
am happy but for the sorrow of leaving
you. Keep in your heart your faith,

<p class="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Shaun."<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Eileen walked back to the village
with her letter clasped in her
hand, a crowd of children surrounded
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what is in it?" shouted one.</p>

<p>"Are the fairies themselves writing
to you?" laughed another.</p>

<p>Eileen shook her curls and would not
answer.</p>

<p>One cried, "Och, you cannot keep it
secret at all, at all! 'Tis from himself&mdash;Shaun
O'Day, and 'tis from America!"</p>

<p>The crowd set up a loud roar. "Yes,
yes, we know! From America! We
saw the mark! 'Tis a fine secret you'd
keep, Eileen!"</p>

<p>Eileen's face became red with anger.</p>

<p>"Stop!" she cried. "'Tis not true!
He's with the fairies! He's in a fairy
city! 'Tis himself says so!"</p>

<p>But the crowd only laughed the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
loudly. "Ho! A fairy city! And why,
then, is the letter marked with the
mark of America?"</p>

<p>Eileen had wondered, too, about this.
She wondered about the postmark. It
said "U.S.A." And that meant United
States of America.</p>

<p>"'Tis a trick of the fairies!" she cried,
believing it herself. "A trick to put us
off their track! 'Tis himself that's
working for the fairy shoemaker in a
fairy city!"</p>

<p>She then told them what Shaun had
said about the lights at night and the
thunder noise. She told how he was
receiving pay for his work and about
the school to which he went.</p>

<p>They stopped shouting and listened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Their jaws fell open. They were forced
to believe that Shaun was truly in the
land of the
leprechaun!</p>

<p>Still, some were doubtful and went away wagging their heads and
sneering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis said that in great cities in the New World such things do be,"
said one.</p>

<p>But Eileen was happy. No matter
where Shaun was, she knew that he
was well. She knew that he thought of
her and that they would meet again
some day.</p>

<p>Letters came often after that. In
each one were tales of great wonder.
Even the most doubtful of the villagers
had to admit that the boy was with
the fairies.</p>

<p>He told of strange people, of amusements,
of towers touching the sky, and
of sights that dazzled his eyes.</p>

<p>Shaun had traveled all the way to a
big American city. A bright, strong
lad was he.</p>

<p>He could always find ways of working
himself along. On ships and trains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
in motors, and upon his two feet he
traveled.</p>

<p>When he arrived in the strange city
across the sea, he sold papers on the
streets.</p>

<p>His clear Irish voice rang out with its
brogue. Many persons smiled as they
listened to the fresh young voice of
Shaun O'Day from Connemara.</p>

<p>But one man stopped and spoke to
the lad. He, too, was an Irishman. He
spoke kindly to Shaun.</p>

<p>The boy told him about his trip and
the strangeness he felt in this new
land. So this Irishman, Pat O'Leary,
took Shaun to his shop.</p>

<p>Pat O'Leary was a shoemaker. He
had a tiny shop on a side street in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
great city. Here he worked at his
trade and lived in a dingy room in the
back of the shop.</p>

<p>'Twas thus that Shaun O'Day found
a home. And 'twas thus that he
started to work for a shoemaker. Pat
O'Leary was not a fairy shoemaker.
But a good fairy was he to the Irish
lad.</p>

<p>He was wrinkled and bent. He might
have been an old leprechaun who had
lost his way upon earth. He was jolly
and smiling, with a joke ever upon his
lips.</p>

<p>Shaun lived and worked with Pat and
was happy. At night he went to school
in the big city and learned many
things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The bright lights, flickering on and
off, made him blink his eyes. The tall
towers and buildings made his neck
stiff with looking up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The noise of the traffic and whistles
and motors and people made his ears
tingle.</p>

<p>But he loved it and wrote each week
to his little friend in Ireland and told
her of the magic of it all. He told it
with a twinkle in his Irish eyes as he
wrote.</p>

<p>He knew she would think he was
with the fairies. He knew she, too,
would think this big city fairyland if
she were here with him.</p>

<p>So he smiled to himself as he wrote
to her. And the smiles tumbled down
from his lips to the paper on which he
wrote.</p>

<p>And when Eileen received the letters
those same smiles jumped up and set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>tled
on her own two pretty lips. She
liked to think that her Shaun was in a
fairy city. He knew she would like to
think it.</p>

<p>So he went on telling her about the
wonders, without ever saying he was
in the city of New York.</p>

<p>It was a simple jest. He would not
have deceived her for worlds. But that
twinkle made him play with her. It
made him write letters that read like
fairy tales.</p>

<p>And sometimes he wrote verse like
this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Towers tall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make Shauneen small<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feel like nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At all, at all!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Years went by. One day a very small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
girl came into the shoemaker's shop.</p>

<p>Shaun was growing to be a tall boy
now. He was tall and manly. But the
Irish bloom was still on his face, with
the smile of his country.</p>

<p>A very small girl came into the shop
with her nurse. While the nurse talked
to Pat O'Leary, the little miss came
over and sat upon a stool by the side
of Shaun O'Day.</p>

<p>He gave her his Irish smile. She gave
him a friendly American smile.</p>

<p>She was a pretty, blond baby, with
teeth as white as milk and eyes the
brown of tree bark.</p>

<p>It was not long before the Irish lad
was telling her the stories of his land.
She sat spellbound while he talked of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the fairies. He worked upon a shoe
while he talked.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus073.jpg" width="600" height="557" alt="TELLING STORIES OF HIS LAND" />
<span class="caption">TELLING STORIES OF HIS LAND</span>
</div>

<p>He told her about the leprechaun. And she thought he might be one, from
the way he looked as he worked upon that shoe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 499px;">
<img src="images/illus077.jpg" width="499" height="600" alt="HE WORKED UPON ONE SHOE WHILE

<span class="caption">HE WORKED UPON ONE SHOE WHILE

</div>

<p>Then her nurse called, "Come, Marjorie. We must go!" Marjorie did not
want to go. She stamped her little foot.</p>

<p>"Come, now," begged Nurse, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to-morrow we will be coming back."</p>

<p>You see, Nurse was Irish, too, and
she loved to talk with Pat O'Leary.</p>

<p>Marjorie could twine Nurse about
her little finger and make her do as she
wished. Marjorie could make almost
everybody do as she wished, for she
was sweet and pretty, and she had
dimples.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 349px;">
<img src="images/illus069.jpg" width="349" height="600" alt="MARJORIE" />
<span class="caption">MARJORIE</span>
</div>

<p>But sometimes she was very stubborn
and naughty. Then she did not
look so pretty. Her dimple did not
seem to be a fairy ripple when she was
cross.</p>

<p>Marjorie and Nurse left the shop.
All that day, Marjorie thought of the
Irish lad's tales.</p>

<p>The next day they came again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the next, and the next. Marjorie loved
to go to the shop each day and listen
to the tales of Shaun O'Day.</p>

<p>But one day a frightful thing happened.
Marjorie's dimple was looking
more like a smudge of dirt than like a
fairy ripple.</p>

<p>It was evening. Marjorie heard the
water running for her bath.</p>

<p>She stamped her foot at Nurse and
cried, "I won't take a bath!"</p>

<p>When Nurse called to her that the
bath was ready, Marjorie was nowhere
to be found. She had run away from
her home.</p>

<p>Marjorie ran to the shop of Pat
O'Leary, straight to Shaun O'Day.</p>

<p>Shaun was surprised and shocked to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
see the little girl alone and at such a
late hour. He was just starting off for
his school.</p>

<p>Marjorie wanted the lad to tell her
tales. But he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Sure, 'tis the wicked child you are,
Miss Marjorie," he said. "And 'tis myself
will carry you back to your home."</p>

<p>So saying, he picked her up under his
arm and took her to her home. Imagine
how surprised her parents were
when they saw this sight at their door.</p>

<p>There was Shaun, the red-haired
Irish lad, standing with their wee
daughter tucked under his big arm.
She was kicking and squealing like a
little pig.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 517px;">

<span class="caption">KICKING AND SQUEALING LIKE A

</div>

<p>"Begging your pardon, sir," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> Shaun to Marjorie's father, "I've
brought you the young lady of the house!"</p>

<p>Marjorie was sent upstairs to bed. I do not know whether her mother
spanked her, but I think she did not. Her mother spoiled her the way
everyone else did.</p>

<p>Downstairs, Shaun told Marjorie's
father how she had come to the shop.
Her father asked Shaun to sit down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
He liked the boy. He asked Shaun
about his life. Marjorie's father wanted
to know about Ireland, too. Shaun
talked with his slow brogue. His blue
eyes twinkled with the truth there was
in them.</p>

<p>Marjorie's father asked Shaun,
"Would you not like to change your
home? Come and work for me in this
house. I will have you taught the work
of a butler, if you will come here and
stay. You shall tell Marjorie tales every
day."</p>

<p>You see, her father was another who
wanted to do everything in the world
for this little American Princess.</p>

<p>So it came about that Shaun changed
his home and his work. He left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
shop of Pat O'Leary. And a letter
came to Dawn O'Day in Ireland.</p>

<p>It said: "So here I am in the house
of a fairy Princess. She did wave her
wand, and I was brought to live here
by her father. 'Tis a good man he is,
too. And I love the baby Princess well
and do be pleasing her with tales of old
Ireland.</p>

<p>"I'm learning the trade of a butler.
I'm after serving themselves out of
golden goblets and glass plates the
color of Ireland's green. The table
shines with bright crystal and silver.
The food is beautiful to look upon.</p>

<p>"Then the pay I do get is indeed
grand. 'Tis all to be saved for our wedding
day, mavourneen."</p>

THE FRIGHTENED GIANT</h2>

<span class="i0">A giant did call at a fairy ball<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>When Marjorie's nurse went out, it
was Shaun who took Marjorie to play
in the park. Sometimes they stayed
in the big gardens of Marjorie's home,
and Shaun told stories.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">SHAUN TOLD MARJORIE STORIES IN THE GARDEN</span>
</div>

<p>But occasionally the little girl liked
to go where she would meet her
friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>On such a day Shaun and Marjorie
were playing ball with the children in
the park. They were throwing the ball
to one another.</p>

<p>Shaun was standing among them
like a giant. He was trying to be gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>tle
as he threw the ball. But all at once
his strength let go and over the tree
tops went the ball.</p>

<p>"O-oh, what a terrible throw!"
sneered a small boy.</p>

<p>Shaun ran and brought back the ball.
He tried to be more careful. But once
he threw it into the duck pond, and at
last he lost it altogether. He heard a
child snickering as he came back from
an unsuccessful search.</p>

<p>Marjorie said, "Let's go home. I'm
tired, anyway."</p>

<p>She looked cross, but she did not say
a word to Shaun on the way home.</p>

<p>That night Shaun was dressing to
help the butler serve dinner. He
looked at his big hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at his strong arms and
sighed, "Och! Shaun O'Day is too big
to be the playmate of a fairy princess!"</p>

<p>But he did not worry until later.</p>

<p>Then that evening when he was
helping wash dishes, the cook said,
"Watch out, boy. You'll break the
dishes yet, with your big, clumsy
hands."</p>

<p>He tried so hard to be careful. He
tried too hard, perhaps, for what
cook had warned him of came to pass.
He broke a precious cup and saucer.</p>

<p>The other servants said nothing, but
smiled behind their hands.</p>

<p>Cook, however, cautioned, "Mind
you don't do that again, boy."</p>

<p>Shaun went to his room with a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
heart that night. What was the matter?
Was he too big, too clumsy?</p>

<p>Would he never learn to be deft and
quick like Perkins the butler? Or neat
and brisk like the chauffeur Paul?</p>

<p>Oh, well, he could only try. He could
be very careful. But anyway, Marjorie
still loved his tales.</p>

<p>He could tell stories and amuse the
Princess. That was one thing none of
the others could do. He fell asleep
smiling.</p>

<p>A few days later, Marjorie told him
that she was planning a birthday party.
She told him about all the amusements
they were to have. Many children
were to be asked.</p>

<p>They would have ice cream and cake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and chocolate in the garden under the
trees. Shaun would serve them.</p>

<p>They would play games, and Shaun
would tell them stories. Oh, that was
to be the best part of all, Marjorie
thought.</p>

<p>Shaun and the little girl planned the
party together. Shaun suggested an
Irish game, and Marjorie said it would
be fun to play it.</p>

<p>So the day arrived. It was a shiny
spring day. It was a pretty sight to see
the little boys and girls running about
and playing together in the green garden.</p>

<p>Marjorie cried out, "Come now!
Shaun will show you how to play his
game."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>And the tall lad stood among the little
children. He tried to make them
understand what fun it was to play an
old Irish game.</p>

<p>It was a game that Shaun had played
and that Shaun's father had played
and perhaps Shaun's father's father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>But these young Americans did not
like it. They said so. They turned
their backs and refused to play it.</p>

<p>So Marjorie said, "Then Shaun will
tell us a story."</p>

<p>The children gathered around Shaun
and he began: "Once upon a time in old
Ireland&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will there be any wars in the story?"
asked one of the children&mdash;a boy, of
course.</p>

<p>Shaun twinkled and replied, "Perhaps."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus090.jpg" width="600" height="466" alt="&quot;ONCE UPON A TIME IN OLD IRELAND&quot;" />
<span class="caption">"ONCE UPON A TIME IN OLD IRELAND"</span>
</div>

<p>Then he went on. He was telling a
fairy tale. The boys began to realize
that it was not about wild Indians and
wars. They twisted and fidgeted. They
dug their heels into the ground, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
one boy pinched another. He squealed
aloud.</p>

<p>"S-sh!" said one girl. "Stop making
that noise!"</p>

<p>But the boys did not want to listen.</p>

<p>One boy stood up and said, "Who
wants to hear about fairies?"</p>

<p>"I don't! I don't!" yelled the others.</p>

<p>Marjorie frowned.</p>

<p>The boys ran away, shouting, "Come
on! Let's play robbers."</p>

<p>Marjorie said, "They would have
liked Shaun's story. They should have
listened. It was awf'lly 'citing! But he
hardly started to tell it."</p>

<p>By this time the group was scattered.
Even the little girls were whispering
together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Shaun got up and walked away. He
walked to a bench at the other end of
the garden and sat down. He was
thinking very deeply.</p>

<p>He sat there until he heard his name
called. He had to go into the house to
help bring out ice cream and cake and
chocolate to Marjorie's guests.</p>

<p>As he served little ice cream boats
and flowers and animals, his thoughts
were far away. The crystal and gold
of the plates and goblets did not seem
so lovely as before.</p>

<p>Everything on the table swam before
Shaun's eyes. Even the children's
faces seemed blurred. He heard their
talk and laughter in a dream.</p>

<p>He was very unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Shaun, do look what you're doing!"
cried a voice in distress.</p>

<p>Shaun looked in horror at what he
had done. He had poured hot chocolate
over the tablecloth. It was trickling
down over a little girl's dress.</p>

<p>Perkins the butler grabbed the chocolate
pot out of Shaun's hand.</p>

<p>He muttered, "Clumsy fellow!" and
started mopping up.</p>

<p>The little girl began to cry.</p>

<p>Shaun went into the kitchen for a
fresh napkin. When he came out to the
party again, he heard the children
snickering and whispering among
themselves. As he approached the
table, they stopped. He knew they
were making sport of his clumsiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at Marjorie. There were
tears in her brown eyes, and she
was biting her lip. That night Shaun
packed his
few things
and left a
letter for
Marjorie.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 557px;">
<img src="images/illus095.jpg" width="557" height="600" alt="THERE WERE TEARS IN MARJORIE'S
BROWN EYES" />
<span class="caption">THERE WERE TEARS IN MARJORIE'S
BROWN EYES</span>
</div>

<p>He told her
that he was
too clumsy
to stay in the
home of a
princess any
longer. He told her that he should never
forget her kindness to him.</p>

<p>Then he wrote another letter and put
a stamp on it. He walked out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
big house with the letter in one hand
and his old Irish carpet bag in the
other.</p>

<p>He walked along the bright city
streets until he came to a mail box. He
kissed the letter and then dropped it
into the box.</p>

<p>Dawn O'Day read the letter a few
weeks later in Ireland.</p>

<p>This is what it said:</p>

<p>"My Dawn O'Day&mdash;</p>

<p>"At last I am leaving the fairy folk.
My fingers have grown too clumsy and
my arms too big for the dainty likes
of the Good People. Those elves, the
children of this bright world, do not be
wanting Shaun O'Day any more.</p>

<p>"And so, little Eileen, I am coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
back to you and Ireland. And in my
pocket is silver and gold to buy us a
wedding and a cottage.</p>

<p>"But the cottage will not be in that
New Island. 'Twill be in the old Emerald
Isle.</p>

<p>
Your Shaun."<br />
</p>

<p>Shaun sold everything he had but an
old suit of clothes. He bought a ticket
on a boat going to England and sailed
away from New York.</p>

<p>As the big ship left behind her the
great American city, the Irish lad saluted
and murmured, "Farewell, fairyland.
'Tis too grand you are for the
likes of a simple lad like me. But, och,
a wonderful, great fairyland you are!"</p>

<p>Slowly the stately harbor disappeared
from view.</p>

<p>They have built a cottage near the
banks of that blue Irish lake. They live
there with their children.</p>

<p>Shaun and Dawn O'Day have three
children. Their youngest is a red-haired
baby girl with the eyes and
the name of her mother.</p>

<p>Their oldest is a lanky, freckle-faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
lad who wears the cast-off trousers of
his father. No more do tall boys wear
the petticoats of girls. They are not
afraid of the leprechaun when they
reach the age of ten or twelve years.</p>

<p>But their mothers still keep them
dressed as girls when they are small.
And that is why we find John, the second
son of Shaun O'Day, in a red petticoat.
He looks very much the way
Shaun himself had looked at that age.</p>

<p>John had been christened Shaun.
But they call him John, because it is to-day
in Ireland. Young Shaun was
called John O'Day.</p>

<p>John had the ruddy complexion given
most of these village lads by the
wind and rain. But he was not as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
tough and strong as his father had
been. He did not have to work. He
could come home from school and do
as he pleased. Sometimes, of course,
he ran errands for his mother or helped
her with household chores. But
usually he would go to the shores of
the lake and think.</p>

<p>Shaun once found his son thus. He
went up to John quietly. He put his
hand on the lad's shoulder. John
jumped and stood erect, his face white.</p>

<p>"Och, why do you jump with such a
great fear, my lad?" asked the father.</p>

<p>John sat down again. He was
ashamed. He did not speak.</p>

<p>"Tell me, lad: What is it you fear?"
asked the father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">HE WOULD GO TO THE SHORES OF THE LAKE</span>
</div>

<p>Then John told his father how some
boy in the village had started a tale.
The lad had told how, many years ago,
Shaun had been stolen away by the
leprechauns.</p>

<p>John told how it had happened on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
shores of this very lake. He would not
believe it and said so.</p>

<p>Still he often lay on his back by the
lake and wondered whether it could be
true. Now he asked Shaun to tell him.</p>

<p>Shaun stroked his rough chin. The
twinkle he had had as a boy was there
in his eyes still. He looked at little
John beside him.</p>

<p>"Och, Johneen!" he laughed with his
musical laugh. "'Tis indeed a true
story."</p>

<p>John's eyes grew big. He stared at
his father as though Shaun himself
might be one of the Good People.</p>

<p>Then he spread out the red petticoat
on the ground. He knew that the red
petticoat would protect him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Shaun looked in amusement at the
boy's frightened eyes. Then he grew
sober.</p>

<p>He said, "You must not fear the
Good People, Johneen!"</p>

<p>John wet his dry lips with the tip of
his tongue. He came up closer to his
father.</p>

<p>"But didn't they make you work for
themselves?" he whispered. "And
weren't they after stealing you away,
and you wearing the clothes of a boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," agreed Shaun. But he
took his little son's hand and stroked
it. "And now," he went on, "if you'll
listen, I'll tell you the story."</p>

<p>Shaun began, "When I was a lad I was
not so fortunate as you, Johneen. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
had to work hard. I was beaten and
had not enough to eat. So I determined
to go with the leprechaun. I put on
the clothes of a boy. I stood by the
lake. But never a fairy came at all, at
all.</p>

<p>"I was tired and slept, and when I
awoke 'twas dawn. I ran to the shore
in a daze. I jumped into a boat. I was
carried away. Through many countries
and on many seas I traveled.</p>

<p>"At last I landed in the fairy city.
'Twas there I met the leprechaun himself."</p>

<p>John's hand squeezed the hand of his
father. He edged up closer to the big
man.</p>

<p>"But do not be thinking that this leprechaun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
was wicked," continued
Shaun. "No, indeed. Kind he was, and
good to me. I worked on the mending
of shoes and was paid in silver.</p>

<p>"Then did I work for a little princess
in the home of her father. Good People
they were, too. And the sight of
the beauty of that home would surely
have dazzled you.</p>

<p>"Among the precious treasures of
that house I worked. With the treasured
little Princess did I play until at
last&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the big man stopped. His voice
grew low and soft. He dropped his
head.</p>

<p>John asked in a hushed whisper, "Yes&mdash;and
what happened?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Och, well&mdash;lad&mdash;I came back to old
Ireland. Your mother was waiting for
me."</p>

<p>Then Shaun arose and placed his
hand on John's shoulder.</p>

<p>He continued, "But remember, son,
that the Good People will not harm
you. Do not be afraid, at all, for well
do they love us. And I do believe that
they steal the wee boys because they
love them so."</p>

<p>Shaun told this tale to the lad John,
so he would never again fear the fairies.</p>

<p>And so well did the plan succeed that
John began to love the Good People.
Over and over, he thought of what
Shaun had told him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>He tried to imagine what the baby
Princess looked like. He would shut
his eyes and try to picture the wonders
of that fairy city.</p>

<p>One day he found himself pretending
that he was flying over the city. He
started and jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>Why had he been doing this? Did he,
too, want to go away with the fairies?
Of course not. Why should he want to
leave his home, his good parents, his
brother and sister?</p>

<p>Laughing aloud, he went back to the
cottage. He did not visit the lake for
several days.</p>

<p>Then one morning, he was walking
by himself in the sunshine. The little
sparkling beams of sun made him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
think of the lights his father had told
him about in the strange city.</p>

<p>Suddenly he found himself on the
banks of the lake. He was on the opposite
shore. He sat down.</p>

<p>He wondered whether the leprechaun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
would steal him if he should
wear the clothes of his big brother.
The brightness of the day and the bird
songs made him light of heart. They
gave him courage.</p>

<p>"Sure, I'll try," he exclaimed to the
blue waters of the lake.</p>

<p>What harm to try? Suppose they
took him. It would be fun to visit
fairyland. He could always come
back. His father came back.</p>

<p>In his new enthusiasm, John stood on
the bank and held out his arms crying,
"Come, fairy Good Folk! Take me
away. I do be wanting to see the wonders
of your land!"</p>

<p>But the gentle lapping of the lake
was the only answer to his cry. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
John realized that he was standing in
the red petticoat. He smiled.</p>

<p>"They'll not be wanting girls, at all,"
he reasoned.</p>

<span class="caption">"THEY'LL NOT BE WANTING GIRLS AT ALL"</span>
</div>

<p>Next day, before anyone in the cottage
was astir, John slipped out of the
door. He was clad in a suit belonging
to his older brother. The trousers hung
very low, but he tucked them up. He
pulled a cap down over his face.</p>

<p>He ran all the way to the opposite
shore of the lake. His heart was
pounding, and his breath came in
gasps.</p>

<p>He threw himself down on the
ground to rest. Bird sounds were all
about, and a rustling of leaves. The
water was lap-lapping as always.</p>

<p>Marjorie was now grown up. She
looked quite different from the tiny
golden-haired girl Shaun had known.
She was a tall, slender young lady.</p>

<p>Her dimple still became a fairy ripple
when she was happy. When she was
cross, it still seemed a smudge of dirt.</p>

<p>Marjorie was often cross now. The
reason was a strange one. She had too
much to make her happy. She had loving
parents and a beautiful home. She
had many friends who adored her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>She was very beautiful, too. Everything
lovely belonged to Marjorie.
Even wealth was
hers.</p>

<p>Her father gave her everything she asked for. She had an automobile. She
had a beautiful glossy horse to ride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>She went to jolly parties, and all the boys wanted to dance with her.
They sent her boxes of chocolate creams and rare flowers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;">
<img src="images/illus112.jpg" width="315" height="600" alt="MARJORIE WAS NOW

<span class="caption">MARJORIE WAS NOW

</div>

<p>But Marjorie was not happy with all
this. She wanted the one thing that she
could not have.</p>

<p>Often she spoke about Shaun O'Day.
He had written to her from Ireland
when he returned. He had sent her a
shamrock and his picture. After that,
she had never heard from him again.</p>

<p>She had cried bitterly for many days
after Shaun's departure. She had
blamed her rude companions for having
insulted the Irish lad. She wanted
him back.</p>

<p>But of course Shaun never went
back to America. He was too happy in
Ireland. You know why he was happy.
He had his Dawn O'Day and his little
children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>So he hardly ever thought of the
baby Princess in "fairyland." He was
too busy working hard to make a living
for his family. He had so little
money. But it did not make him unhappy.
Sometimes it is a good thing
when people have to work. It makes
them happy.</p>

<p>You see how discontented Marjorie
was. And she had so much! But she
finally found a wish that seemed impossible
to grant.</p>

<p>When she knew that she might never
have Shaun again, she wanted him
more than ever. She pleaded with her
father to send for him. But that was
one thing her father would not do.</p>

<p>He knew that the lad could never be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a><br /><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
happy in this land. He knew that
Shaun had the dreams of Ireland in his
heart. Shaun belonged in Ireland.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">SHAUN HAD THE DREAMS OF IRELAND</span>
</div>

<p>Many years passed, and Marjorie
never forgot Shaun. She often looked
at the young men who danced with her
or who took her to the theater.</p>

<p>She often thought, "He is not so nice
as Shaun O'Day!"</p>

<p>She imagined Shaun even finer than
he was. She had really forgotten what
he was like, and she made a prince of
him in her thoughts.</p>

<p>"I shall never be happy until I find
Shaun O'Day once more!" she said.</p>

<p>One day Marjorie asked her father if
he would take her abroad. She wanted
to visit the countries of Europe. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
father consented, and the family sailed
away on a fine ship.</p>

<p>They were going to France and Germany
and Italy and many other countries.
They had not thought of going
to Ireland. But Marjorie knew that
they were going to Ireland!</p>

<p>And in Ireland, poor little John
O'Day sat by the lake waiting for the
fairies. He had waited there for many
days. At first he sat very still with the
clumsy trousers rolled up his legs and
the big cap falling over his eyes.</p>

<p>He sat still and listened for a sound.
He heard only the lake lapping.</p>

<p>Then he began to bring his books
along. He liked the books about Ireland
that they gave him at school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>He thought the pictures of Dublin
and Belfast looked very like that fairy
city of which his father had told. He
looked at those pictures for hours and
hours. And he waited there by the
banks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">&mdash;LOOKED AT THOSE PICTURES FOR HOURS AND HOURS</span>
</div>

<p>He always changed to his red petticoat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
before he went home. He did not
want anyone to know what he was doing.
Some might laugh at him.</p>

<p>His mother would be frightened and
hold him close. She might make him
promise never to do it again. Then he
would never see the fairies.</p>

<p>His brother could not imagine what
had become of his old suit of clothes.
He had to wear his Sunday suit until
he could make enough money to buy
a new suit. But the days slipped by,
and the boy waited in vain for the
leprechaun. The longing for adventure
was great in his heart.</p>

<p>One day he stepped to the edge of the
lake and cried out in a loud voice,
"Arrah, 'tis long I've waited and tired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
I am! Come, Good Folk, come! Give
to the son of Shaun O'Day the great
wonders of your fairy powers!"</p>

<p>As his voice died down, he stepped
back from the edge of the water. He
looked about cautiously. Then his
heart gave a leap. He had heard a tiny
sound. It was not the lapping lake. It
was not the wind in the trees.</p>

<p>It was surely a fairy. And as he was
thinking these thoughts, he saw her.</p>

<p>She came gliding over the ground
like a rainbow. Her gown was lavender
and blue, flowing and billowy. Her
dainty little shoes were snow-white.
And her hair was spun gold.</p>

<p>A many-colored scarf twined about
her neck and fluttered in the breeze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
There was a beautiful perfume in the
air as she appeared.</p>

<p>The boy backed into the bushes. He
stared out at the lovely vision. His
eyes were wild with fear.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus121.jpg" width="600" height="467" alt="HE STARED OUT AT THE LOVELY VISION" />
<span class="caption">HE STARED OUT AT THE LOVELY VISION</span>
</div>

<p>The beautiful creature came closer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
She held out her hand and smiled. Her
hand was snow-white. Her smile was
a sunbeam, with a dimple in it.</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid," said her clear,
sweet voice. "You called the fairies,
son of Shaun O'Day?"</p>

<p>John nodded, but could not speak.
His mouth was dry.</p>

<p>"I have come at your command," she
smiled. Then she led John out and
looked at him for a long time. She was
smiling kindly. At last she spoke.</p>

<p>"You are the son of Shaun O'Day.
And I am the fairy Princess who once
stole Shaun from the leprechaun. I
used to hear his fine stories of Ireland.
I loved to listen to him. He used to play
with me in fairyland. Did he tell you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>John looked into her sparkling
brown eyes and said, "Sure, and he did.
He told me about it all. And I did be
wanting to go with the fairies, too."</p>

<p>She laughed a silvery laugh and put
her arm about John. "And so you
shall," she said. "Come with me. Let
me show you to our fairy chariot."</p>

<p>She led him away. They walked for
quite a while until they came to a
dusty road. It was a road on which
many donkey carts travel, but few
automobiles.</p>

<p>She drew him to the side of a shining
automobile. It was the most beautiful
thing John had ever seen.</p>

<p>"Enter, Shaun," said the girl fairy.</p>

<p>John looked at her for just an instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
with a question on his lips. She had
called him Shaun. Why?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">"YOU ARE THE SON OF SHAUN O'DAY"</span>
</div>

<p>But she stopped his question and
said, "We shall fly over the ground
now. Hold on tight."</p>

<p>For the next hour, the boy John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
hardly breathed with excitement. He
was being carried over the ground
faster than ever he had gone in his life.</p>

<p>Trees and fields and pigs and donkeys
flew by. Thatched cottages
seemed to dart out at them and then
disappear.</p>

<p>The girl fairy sat at the big wheel of
the car and only smiled at him occasionally.
She said never a word.</p>

<p>At last they drew up at the side of
a lonely road. She stopped the flying
car. She turned to him.</p>

<p>She said, "Now Shauneen, what do
you want me to do for you?"</p>

<p>John took a deep breath and clutched
the side of the car.</p>

<p>Then he answered slowly, "Faith!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
I'm after longing to visit fairyland."</p>

<p>The girl fairy's smile vanished for a
moment. Then she took his hand in
hers and spoke seriously.</p>

<p>"Shauneen," she said, "I cannot take
you there. But I can show you a land
as beautiful as fairyland. I can take
you all about your own land, Ireland.
Do you know that the poets have
called Ireland fairyland? Do you know
that there is no greener spot on
earth?"</p>

<p>John's eyes glowed.</p>

<p>He answered, "Indeed, I do know it.
And I'm forever seeing the pictures in
the school books. Sure, I do believe
I'd rather be seeing Ireland than any
fairyland at all!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">"ENTER, SHAUN," SAID THE GIRL FAIRY</span>
</div>

<p>"Good!" laughed the girl fairy. Then
she grew serious again as she said,
"But Shauneen, you must promise
your fairy that you will not speak of
this to anyone at all. You must also
ask your father to come to the shore of
the lake to-morrow morning while you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
are at school. Tell him that there is
some one who would speak with him on
a serious matter. But do not say any
more. If you obey these two commands,
your fairy will come again. She
will come for you on the shores of the
lake. She will take you to all parts of
your own beautiful country."</p>

<p>John promised to carry out her
wishes. Again they flew over the
ground until at last they were back at
the spot whence they had started.</p>

<p>Then John stepped out of the glistening
automobile. The girl fairy
threw him a kiss and was off in a cloud
of dust.</p>

<p>John was in school. But his mind
was not on his lessons. For the first
time, the letters in his book swam before
his eyes. The teacher's voice
seemed far away.</p>

<p>He was thinking of the girl fairy and
of his coming trip with her. She had
told him to say nothing, and he must
obey her. But he could not help thinking
about her. Surely she was good
and would let no harm befall him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>His father had told him that the
Good People were kind and loved little
boys. So he smiled and paid no attention
to his school work.</p>

<p>The teacher set him in a corner with
a dunce's cap on his head.</p>

<p>In the meantime, John's father was
walking to the shore of the lake. He
wondered who wanted to see him. John
had told him that it was an important
matter.</p>

<p>He scratched his red head and puzzled.
He waited on the banks of the
lake until he heard a light step behind
him.</p>

<p>He turned and saw John's girl fairy.
She walked over to him silently. He
jumped up and looked at her. Shaun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a><br /><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
thought he had never seen so exquisite
a being. She spoke.</p>

<p>"You are Shaun O'Day," she said
softly. She held out something and
continued, "Please take this."</p>

<p>Shaun took from her graceful white
hand a slip of paper. She kept looking
into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Read it, Shaun," she said.</p>

<p>Shaun opened the paper. His eyes
fell on his own boyish handwriting and
a shamrock pasted across the top of
the letter.</p>

<p>"Faith, 'tis a letter I wrote, myself,
when I was a lad!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The girl fairy only smiled and kept
looking into Shaun's eyes.</p>

<p>"Begob!" he suddenly shouted, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
hard at the girl fairy. "'Tis Miss
Marjorie, the baby Princess!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Shaun," answered Marjorie
happily. "'Tis Marjorie come all the
way from fairyland to see you."</p>

<p>Then the two sat down on the bank.
Shaun took off his coat and spread it
on the ground for the girl to sit upon.
They talked and laughed and remembered
old times together.</p>

<p>Suddenly Marjorie grew serious and
said, "Shaun, I have seen your son!"</p>

<p>Shaun looked surprised.</p>

<p>Marjorie continued, "Shaun, I want
you to help me. I want to give a great
pleasure to your little John."</p>

<p>Then she told Shaun how John had
seen her the previous day. She told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
how John had believed her to be a
fairy. She told Shaun that she had
promised to take the little lad on a trip
through Ireland.</p>

<p>She finished by saying, "I want to
make him happy, Shaun, as you made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
me, long ago. Will you say that I may
take him?"</p>

<p>Shaun's eyes were moist. He felt
very grateful to the girl.</p>

<p>He replied in a low voice, "Och, Miss
Marjorie, you are indeed no fairy, but
a great good angel!"</p>

<p>Marjorie jumped up gayly and cried,
"Then you will let him go with me,
Shaun?"</p>

<p>"And sure you know well I will, Miss
Marjorie. 'Tis a great good you will be
doing for my lad. It is surely," he said.</p>

<p>Marjorie looked very serious then.
And she bowed her head.</p>

<p>Her words were whispers as she said,
"If it is a great good, then it is the first
great good I have ever done. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
been very selfish, Shaun. Everyone
has always done for me. This is the
first time I have ever done something
to give some one else pleasure. And,
oh," she suddenly clasped her hands
together and smiled radiantly, "it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
wonderful feeling! It has made me
happy, Shaun."</p>

<p>She kissed his rough brown hand and
turned on her dainty heel. She fled before
Shaun could utter a sound.</p>

<p>"Well, begob, begorra!" he at last
sputtered, scratching his head and
wrinkling his nose. "Now isn't it a
great wonder?"</p>

<p>Then, as if some breeze had contradicted
him, he nodded his head and said
loudly, "It is surely!"</p>

<p>It was several days before Marjorie's
next visit to the lake.</p>

<p>Although the little boy John went
thither daily and waited longingly, no
girl fairy appeared. But he never
doubted that she would come. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
knew she would keep her promise. And
she did.</p>

<p>At last, one day, she came tripping
over the ground, laughing and calling,
"Shauneen, Shauneen, 'tis I!"</p>

<p>John trembled. But he smiled at her
and held out his hand.</p>

<p>To-day she was not dressed in fluttering,
light-colored garments. Instead,
she had on a brown leather coat.
She wore a little round cap.</p>

<p>She carried a small coat, which she
held out to John.</p>

<p>"Put this on quickly and come, for
our air chariot awaits us," she exclaimed,
helping John put on the fine
warm coat.</p>

<p>Again they walked to the shining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
white automobile, and then they drove
and drove. At last they came to a large
field. It was an air port, a place where
airplanes land.</p>

<p>The girl stopped her car. John saw
a winged machine standing in the center<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of the field. It was a strange, terrible
thing to the boy John.</p>

<p>"Come," said Marjorie, taking him
by the hand. "It is our airplane. We
shall fly over the green land together!"</p>

<p>An airplane! John had seen airplanes
before, but never like this. He had
seen them circling far up in the sky.</p>

<p>He could often hear the whirring
sound they made. They usually were
so high that they looked to the lad like
small birds.</p>

<p>But this one was a monster. There
was a pilot ready to start the plane and
carry them off. They stepped inside
the monster. John sat beside Marjorie,
and she held his hand. He edged
up close to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>The plane's motor started. They began
to rise from the ground. Oh,
it was like being
a bird, John
thought. It was
even like being a
fairy.</p>

<p>He stole a
glance at the girl
fairy. She was
beaming at him.</p>

<p>"Do you like
this, Shauneen?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Faith, 'tis surely
a great wonder! And you the good
angel!" breathed the boy.</p>

<p>Marjorie remembered Shaun had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
said those same words to her. She felt
happier than she had felt ever before
in her life.</p>

<p>It was a trip that John O'Day never
would forget. John would remember
that trip to his ninetieth birthday.</p>

<p>They flew in the plane to the city of
Dublin. They stopped at a fine hotel,
and the girl fairy gave John a handsome
little traveling bag with everything
in it that he needed.</p>

<p>There were soft, fine pajamas. There
was a new suit of clothes. There was
a cap to match his coat, with fine socks
and shoes.</p>

<span class="caption">SHE GAVE JOHN A HANDSOME LITTLE TRAVELING BAG</span>
</div>

<p>They started out early the next
morning to see all of Dublin town. A
great city it seemed to John, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a><br /><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
strange noises and its jostling mobs on
the streets.</p>

<p>In the center of O'Connell Street
stands Nelson's Pillar. It is a thin, tall
pillar. Inside there are one hundred
and sixty-six steps which wind right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
up to the top. John and Marjorie
walked up to the top and stood looking
down on the streets below.</p>

<p>John noticed later when they walked
in the streets that some of the signs
were written in Irish.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">SOME OF THE SIGNS WERE WRITTEN IN IRISH</span>

<p>John was just learning to read Irish
in school. So he could read some of the
signs.</p>

<p>School children have to study the
Irish language in that part of Ireland
called the Free State. The Free State
is free from Great Britain and has its
own government. It is the southern
part of the country, and Dublin is the
capital.</p>

<p>The northern part of Ireland is still
under the government of England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
The County Galway, wherein John's
village stood, belongs to the Free
State.</p>

<p>Policemen on the streets of Dublin
wear caps with silver harps on their
visors. You know that the harp is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
symbol of Ireland, and it is used on the
new flag of the Irish Free State.</p>

<p>Dublin is a quaint and ancient city.
There are few automobiles on the
streets.</p>

<p>One sees many jaunting cars, which
are funny little high carts with a seat
on each side and big wheels. People
sit with their legs hanging over the
sides, while the driver sits up on the
high box and drives an old thin horse.</p>

<span class="caption">A JAUNTING CAR</span>
</div>

<p>There are also many bicycles whirling
along in Dublin.</p>

<p>Children seem to be everywhere.
Some look very poor, indeed. Some
beg the wealthy people for money.
There are many beggars. They crouch
beside buildings and on the steps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
churches. John and his fair guide
visited Phoenix Park in Dublin. After
Yellowstone Park in the United States,
Phoenix Park is the largest in the
world.</p>

<p>The Royal Hibernian Military School
in Phoenix Park is used by the Free
State Irish Speaking Union as a school
to teach the Irish language to young
men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>They visited St. Patrick's College
where a large number of students attend.
This is a fine old college.</p>

<p>They left Dublin after seeing everything
of interest there. They left in a
drizzling rain in Marjorie's big white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
motor car. It had been brought to them
from the flying field to Dublin. It
seemed to John that things were always
being brought to Marjorie in a
magical way. And why not? Marjorie
was a fairy! Now they motored to the
Vale of Avoca.</p>

<p>This is the beautiful woodland spot
where Tom Moore, the Irish poet,
wrote much of his poetry.</p>

<p>While John traveled with his good
fairy, his mother and father sat before
their fireside. They talked for hours
about the lad's good fortune.</p>

<p>Of course Shaun explained to his wife
that the girl was no fairy. He told
Dawn O'Day that she was Marjorie,
the baby Princess, for whom he had
worked so long ago.</p>

<p>Dawn O'Day was pleased to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
how much her boy was learning. She
loved to think that some day little
John might be a great, wise man.</p>

<p>And the boy was indeed learning, and
seeing all manner of wonders. Together
he and Marjorie visited the
Giant's Causeway, which is in the
northern part of Ireland. The Giant's
Causeway is a very remarkable place.</p>

<p>It is supposed to have been made by
the giants of old. It is believed by
some that the queer rocks were built
by giants. These great monsters were
trying to make a great bridge across
the water to join Ireland and Scotland.</p>

<p>Of course this is only a fairy tale. But
those huge, queer rocky forms do look
as though giants had built them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The water roars up to the shore and
often splashes over those strange, tall
rocks. They are probably the result of
a terrible eruption by some volcano,
or fire mountain, years ago.</p>

<p>The rocks form many peculiar
shapes. There is the Giant's Organ&mdash;a
group of immense rocks resembling
a mighty organ.</p>

<p>There is the Wishing Chair, a single
column backed by higher ones. It
forms a very comfortable chair. And
they tell you that if you make a wish
there, it will come true. But never
must you speak that wish aloud.</p>

<span class="caption">THE WISHING CHAIR</span>

<p>There is a well of clear, fresh water
within a few feet of the Atlantic
Ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>There is the gate which stands as the
gate to Giant Land.</p>

</div>

<p>There are the Giant's Eyeglass, the
Chimney Tops, the Loom, and other
forms of great size made of these
strange rocks. It is no wonder that the
people think of giants, when looking at
them.</p>

<p>The little boy and his guide visited
the mountain of Crough Patrick, one
of the sacred places of Ireland.</p>

<p>It is where St. Patrick stood when he
banished all snakes and other reptiles
from Ireland. This is supposed to
have happened in the year 450 A.D.</p>

<p>St. Patrick imprisoned all creeping
things in a deep canyon and kept them
there. When he was ready to destroy
them, he stood upon the summit of the
mountain with a bell in his hand.</p>

<p>He stood there and rang that bell.
And each time he rang that bell thousands
of snakes and other creeping
creatures went tumbling into the sea.</p>

<p>In Ireland to-day there are no snakes,
toads, or poisonous reptiles. The people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
believe that it is because St. Patrick
destroyed them all, many years
ago.</p>

<p>In July many pilgrims climb to this
mountain. They pray there to St. Patrick.</p>

<p>John and Marjorie went to the Lakes
of Killarney. These are perhaps the
best known lakes in all the world.
Songs and poems have been written
about their beauty.</p>

<p>There are three lakes. Each one has
a peculiar beauty of its own. The lakes
lie between mountains like brilliant
diamonds glistening in an emerald
setting.</p>

<p>They tell a legend in Killarney. They
say that once no lakes were there at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
all. One man living there had a magic
well. If he always kept the well covered,
no harm would come.</p>

<p>But one night somebody came to the
well for water and forgot to cover it.
The next morning a great flood had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
swallowed up the land. The town was
completely under water.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the natives say, one can
still see, at the bottom of the lakes,
this old town with the same old well.
The Irish do love to be telling tales of
magic.</p>

<p>Blarney Castle is noted for the famous
Blarney Stone. It is said that
those who kiss the Blarney Stone forever
afterward possess the art of flattery
and beautiful speech.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 445px;">
<img src="images/illus164.jpg" width="445" height="600" alt="BLARNEY CASTLE" />
<span class="caption">BLARNEY CASTLE</span>
</div>

<p>You have often heard people say,
"You must have kissed the Blarney
Stone!"</p>

<p>People who make many compliments
are sometimes accused of kissing
the Blarney Stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor is it an easy object to kiss! John
O'Day and Marjorie climbed to the top
of Blarney Castle. There the old stone
hangs from the top of the battlements.
It lies in a peculiar position.</p>

<p>John lay flat and thrust his head
down about three feet through an
opening. He then twisted his neck in
order to kiss the precious stone. A
guard held his feet.</p>

<p>It was a wise thing to do, for it is
over a hundred feet to the ground below!
It would be a terrible fall!</p>

<p>As they traveled, they passed beautiful
green country. They saw many
pigs and many donkey carts.</p>

<span class="caption">THEY PASSED DONKEY CARTS</span>
</div>

<p>In every village they found a war
memorial. Some of these memorials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
stand in the center of the town. Some
are very large and beautiful. Others
are small. But all mean the same
thing. Ireland lost many soldiers in
the Great War.</p>

<p>They found few fruits growing in
Ireland. Gooseberries are plentiful,
and they ate many.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Marjorie found the Irish peasants
friendly and kind. Several times they
stopped for the night in farmhouses.</p>

<p>The people told Marjorie many wonderful
tales as she sat before their firesides.
They were very much surprised
to find the girl traveling about alone
with a young child.</p>

<p>But she only laughed in her easy way,
as the old women said, "God be
praised, but American girls do be
knowing no fear!"</p>

<p>Marjorie always made John go to bed
right after dinner. The little boy was
tired from his long day's travels. He
was tired, too, with seeing and hearing
so many new things. So he did not hear
the people talking at night. He still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
believed his girl fairy was one of the
Good People.</p>

<p>One day they were stopping in a
small village. Marjorie left John alone
with the car and went into a shop to
buy some cakes.</p>

<p>A group of little boys came over to
the car. Their eyes were very curious,
indeed.</p>

<p>They began to talk to John. When
they heard his accent they knew at
once that he was Irish.</p>

<p>One boy said, "'Tis surely a rich
American lady driving the automobile?"</p>

<p>John looked at him in a pitying manner.
"And don't you know a fairy when
you see one?" he asked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a><br /><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<p>The boys' mouths opened. They
stared at John.</p>

<p>Then one boy came close to John and
cried out, "Arrah, 'tis no fairy, at all, at
all! 'Tis an American lady from across
the seas!"</p>

<p>John faced the boy. There was a
frown on his face.</p>

<p>"You'll not be standing there saying
that again!" he said. "'Tis herself is
one of the Good People!"</p>

<p>The boy laughed again. "Och, you
know well she is no fairy!"</p>

<p>"She is!" yelled John.</p>

<p>"She is not!" shrieked the boy.</p>

<p>John rolled up his sleeves. He hit the
boy.</p>

<p>When Marjorie came out of the shop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
she found her young friend in a fierce
battle. She separated the boys and
thrust John into the car. He was waving
his arms and shouting.</p>

<p>Marjorie jumped into the driver's
seat. She started the car, and off they
went.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;">
<img src="images/illus167.jpg" width="454" height="600" alt="SHE SEPARATED THE BOYS" />
<span class="caption">SHE SEPARATED THE BOYS</span>
</div>

<p>John's clothing was torn. He was
bruised. The boy with whom he had
fought was larger than he. But John
knew that he had left the other boy as
bruised and torn as he was himself. So
he smiled.</p>

<p>Marjorie drove for a while in silence.</p>

<p>Then she asked, "John, why did you
fight?"</p>

<p>John told her the reason. She bit her
lip and was silent again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a><br /><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>
<p>Then she said, "John, how do you
know that I am a fairy?"</p>

<p>The little boy answered promptly,
"Because I was after calling the fairies
that day by the lake. And because I
did take off my petticoat and put on
the clothes of a boy."</p>

<p>"Do you believe that was the reason
I took you away?" asked Marjorie.</p>

<p>"I do," answered John firmly. "And,"
he continued, "if I had been in the petticoats
of a girl, you would never have
noticed me at all."</p>

<p>"Why?" Marjorie queried.</p>

<p>"Sure, and the Good People do be
wanting the boys to work for themselves.
They'll not be noticing girls,
and they so weak!" John answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Marjorie frowned. Then she said,
"But I have not made you work."</p>

<p>John looked at her quickly and replied,
"Och, no! But 'tis willing I am to
work for you now. Only&mdash;" He hesitated.</p>

<p>"Only what, John?" asked the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll not be wanting to stay away forever
from my mother and father,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>Marjorie put an arm about his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Do you know that we are almost at
your home now?" She laughed gayly.
"Look about you!"</p>

<p>The little boy was amazed to see that
they really had returned. They were
on the same dusty road whence they
had started their trip so many days
ago.</p>

<p>Marjorie drew the car up to the side
of the road and stopped it.</p>

<p>"Now you may jump out and run
home to your mother and father," she
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>John O'Day just stood and stared
at her.</p>

<p>"And you'll not be asking me to work
at all?" he questioned, with wondering
eyes.</p>

<p>Marjorie shook her head and smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Och," cried the boy, "but I want to
do something for you!"</p>

<p>Marjorie stroked his hand and replied
softly, "It is not necessary,
Shauneen. Your father did so very
much for me many years ago. I am
glad that I can now give his son a little
happiness."</p>

<p>"And will you not be coming back
again to the lake, good fairy?" asked
John.</p>

<p>Marjorie's smile faded as she answered,
"Shauneen, I am not a fairy.
You must believe that. I shall come
back to the lake to see you. But I
shall come to bid you good-bye, for I
am going back to America."</p>

<p>For a moment John was almost going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to believe her. His throat felt
choky. Then suddenly he shook his
head and laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"Sure, 'tis not so at all, at all!" he
laughed. "There's not a girl in all the
world as beautiful as you. There's not
a girl in all the world so good and kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Faireen. Och, no! Not even the girls
from the land of America! 'Tis indeed
the fairy you are!"</p>

<p>The little boy climbed out of the car.
He saw a shamrock growing by the
side of the road. He ran and picked it.
He gave it to Marjorie. Then he kissed
her hand and ran as fast as he could.</p>

<span class="caption">THEN HE KISSED HER HAND</span>
</div>

<p>He left the girl staring after him in
real amazement. So he would not believe
her! He thought that she was a
fairy! Ah, well, she must certainly
show him in some way that what she
told him was true.</p>

<p>She did not want to leave Ireland and
feel that she had deceived the boy.
Still, she loved to think that he believed
her to be a fairy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a beautiful dream to John.
She did not like to disturb that beautiful
dream. Puzzled, she shook her
head as she started her car. Then she
was off, down the dusty road.</p>

<p>John O'Day walked slowly through
the village. He walked through the village
because he wanted all the boys to
see his fine suit.</p>

<p>The fine suit was a bit torn and soiled
from the fight he had had. Still John
was proud of it.</p>

<p>He went home by way of the village.
He did not go by way of the lake. As
he walked down the village street, the
people stared at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"And where are you going, John
O'Day?" called one boy.</p>

<p>"Sure, I'm not going," answered the
little lad. "I'm after coming back from
where I was!"</p>

<p>He marched along. They all stood
with staring eyes and watched him.</p>

<p>He came to the cottage of his parents,
and when they saw him they were
delighted.</p>

<p>Of course, John told his mother and
father everything.</p>

<p>He tried to tell it all before he went
to bed. But the evening was too short
and his tale too long. He was fairly
bursting with the great trip he had
had.</p>

<p>He even had a tale of wonder for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
wee sister. He held her on his knee
while he told about the big zoo in Dublin.</p>

<p>"Sure, and there's every kind of animal
there," he went on, his eyes flashing.
"Sure, I was after seeing a terrible,
big creature. 'Twas an elephant
they called it. And 'tis a square animal
with a tail in front of it and a tail behind
it!"</p>

<p>"Glory be!" cried his mother.</p>

<p>Shaun smiled behind his pipe. The
baby gurgled.</p>

<p>The older brother pretended that he
was not very much interested. He was,
though. He was greatly excited with
John's tales.</p>

<p>Then his father said, "But, Johneen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
you do not really believe that your
guide was a fairy?"</p>

<p>"Sure, and the best one in all fairyland,"
answered John stoutly.</p>

<p>Shaun scratched his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Och, Johneen," he said, "you do not
believe that surely."</p>

<p>But John answered, "I do!"</p>

<p>Shaun then drew the boy over to his
chair. He took John on his lap.</p>

<p>"Listen, son," he said.</p>

<p>He told the child the same thing that
Marjorie had told him. He told John
that Marjorie was really a girl from
America.</p>

<p>But John replied as he had replied to
Marjorie in the car. He said that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
could not be a girl so lovely and kind as
she. He insisted that Marjorie could
only be a fairy!</p>

<p>Several days went by. John told everyone
in the village about his trip. He
talked of nothing else. He had gone to
the lake day after day, but the girl
fairy had never appeared.</p>

<p>He did not give up hope, however.
He felt she would keep her promise
and come again to see him.</p>

<p>Then one day little John received a
package and a letter. In the package
were several beautiful books. He
asked his father to read the letter to
him.</p>

<p>Shaun read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"Dear Shauneen: To-morrow I am
coming to the lake to say good-bye to
you. Please be there. Marjorie."</p></blockquote>

<p>Shaun folded the letter and gave it
back to his son.</p>

<p>Then he said, "You see, she is an
American girl. Her father and mother
are going to take her back to America.
They brought her over, and they also
bought her that car. They arranged for
her to take you on that fine trip. Don't
you see now that she surely is not a
fairy?"</p>

<p>But John did not answer. He shook
his head stubbornly. Suddenly Shaun
had an idea.</p>

<p>He said, "I must show you then." He
put his two hands on the boy's shoulders
and looked into his eyes. "To-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>morrow,"
he said, "when you go to
meet her at the lake you must wear
the red petticoat!"</p>

<p>John looked frightened.</p>

<p>He cried, "Och, father, she'll not be
talking to me at all&mdash;and I in girl's
clothes!"</p>

<p>Shaun said, "Sure, that is just what
she will do. She'll know you well. She'll
talk to you. Then you will believe at
last that she is no fairy!"</p>

<p>The morning came. John dressed as
usual in his red petticoat. He took the
books that Marjorie had sent him and
ran to the lake. He was there with the
first birds. He was there with the
sleepy sun.</p>

<p>The sleepy sun was just waking up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
But John O'Day had been awake for
many hours. He had been so very
much awake with his thoughts.</p>

<p>He thought and thought about Marjorie.
He wondered and wondered
whether Marjorie would recognize
him. If she should speak to him, he
would know that she really was a girl.
He would know that she was not a
fairy.</p>

<p>If she passed him by, he would be
sure that she was a real fairy. Oh, he
felt so sure that she was a fairy!</p>

<p>But at the same time he wondered
just a little bit why she tried to make
him believe she was not. Was it because
the Good People do not want
folks to be talking about them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Maybe it was that. They like to give
happiness to people. But they do not
want people knowing that it is they
giving the happiness.</p>

<p>They do not ask thanks. They do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
look for praise. The Good People are
modest.</p>

<p>But soon John would know about his
lovely friend. She would soon appear
and look for him. If she passed him by,
his heart would beat with joy. He
would know then.</p>

<p>And he would call out to her, "It is I!
It is your Shauneen! Do you not know
me?"</p>

<p>Then she would stop and he would
laugh at her and jolly her.</p>

<p>He would say, "You could not be
fooling me, good fairy. Isn't it myself
knows a fairy when I see one?"</p>

<p>He chuckled to himself. She should
not be fooling John O'Day!</p>

<p>He opened one of the lovely books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
which Marjorie had sent him. He began
to look at it. It was a beautiful
book with colored pictures in it. It had
grand pictures of cities in it.</p>

<p>There were pictures of Irish cities
and French cities and American cities.</p>

<p>John grew so interested in looking at
the pictures that he did not hear a step
behind him. He did not see Marjorie
standing behind him. She was smiling
down at him as he sat all wrapped in
joy and delight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus184.jpg" width="600" height="526" alt="SHE WAS SMILING DOWN AT HIM" />
<span class="caption">SHE WAS SMILING DOWN AT HIM</span>
</div>

<p>He was remembering his trip
through the cities whose pictures he
now looked at in a book. He was in
Dublin again. He had jumped right
into the book and was believing that
he could hear the dull sounds of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
city. He was believing that he could
see the many people and cars and
curious sights.</p>

<p>Marjorie watched him for a few moments.
She knew
John O'Day,
though he wore
a girl's petticoat.
She had come to
bid him good-bye,
for she was leaving
for her own
country.</p>

<p>But she could
not disturb him
as he sat there.
She could not disturb
John O'Day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
while at his books. Nor could she disturb
his dreams.</p>

<p>She knew well that if she spoke to
him now, he would know that she was
not a fairy. He had told her that "fairies
do not be speaking to girls," and
Marjorie could not disturb the little
boy's beautiful dream of her.</p>

<p>So she scribbled a note and left it on
a flat rock. The note told John that she
had come and gone. It said that Marjorie
was sorry she had not seen her
Shauneen again. But she left him with
his dream of her.</p>

<p>When John lifted his head and heart
out of the pages of that grand book, he
stood up and looked about. He saw the
letter and opened it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course he could not read it, but he
found something else with the letter
which he kissed. It was the picture of
his girl fairy. She had left it there.</p>

<p>And now John O'Day knew that she
had come and gone.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 235px;">
<img src="images/illus187.jpg" width="235" height="400" alt="IT WAS THE PICTURE OF HIS
GIRL FAIRY" />
<span class="caption">IT WAS THE PICTURE OF HIS
GIRL FAIRY</span>
</div>

<p>Thought he, "She did not know the
little figure in the red petticoat was
her friend Shauneen! No; she did not
notice this little girl at all, at all. Fairies
do not be speaking to little girls."</p>

<p>She had gone. But she had left behind
her the picture of a girl fairy. She
had left that picture on a flat rock.</p>

<p>And she had left it, too, in the Irish
heart of John O'Day, who had the
dreams of his country.</p>

<p>Marjorie will always remember the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
little boy. She will go back to America
and always remember the boy who
called her a good fairy. She will try
really to be a good fairy because of
that.</p>

<p>She will not think so much about her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>self
any more. But she will try to give
pleasure to others because of the
pleasure she finds in doing it.</p>

<p>And as John O'Day grows older, perhaps
he will find out the truth about
Marjorie. But he will always be wanting
to believe that she was a girl fairy,
even if he finds that she was not.</p>

<p>He will always want to keep his
dreams, because he is Irish.</p>
